  <summary> Day 1</summary>
  
  First day went pretty easily in both languages.
  Used a similar strategy in both with data frames.
  Felt a little weird to add all the window columns in python, 
  didn't really need to but wanted to check the shifts.
  For both, would probably be good to find a way to make an actual sliding window
  since my solutions don't allow for easy adjustment of window size.

  <summary> Day 2</summary>
  
  Solution in python was pretty easy with functions and for loops.
  Tried an inelegant tidy solution in R which worked okay for part 1 
  because it was looking for a sum but couldn't figure out how to make it work for part 2.
  In my solution for part 1 I didn't track the position so that made it difficult to adjust
  for part 2.  I also separated the depth and horizontal position calculations which are 
  both needed in part 2. Will look to see if anyone else had an interesting solution I can
  learn from.

  <summary> Day 3</summary>
  
  Python solutions were fun.  I probably could have done with another function to clean
  up the repeated while loops in pt 2.  I am starting to like while loops more.
  The R pt 1 was pretty nice with a tidy solution.  Could probably repeat my python
  solution in R but think I'll only do R parts where I can think of a solution with data
  frames or mapping or something.
